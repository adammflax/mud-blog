The purpose of this blog is to document my progress as I attempt to learn Clojure & ClojureScript by writing a [multi-user dungeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD).

Why a multi user dungeon?
------------------------
Not long ago I was cleaning out my closet and I found this book still in reasonable condition, CD notwithstanding!

I've always wanted to make a game however my goal at the moment is to learn Clojure. By working on a MUD I can focus on the programming aspect of game development which is a double win as Im a terrible arist.

Why Clojure?
------------
The book ontop of the MUD book was a clojure book!
