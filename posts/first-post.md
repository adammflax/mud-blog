Hello Again
-----------
Around 9 months ago I started a blog to create a [multi-user dungeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) in Clojure and Clojurescript as a consequence of me
finding an old book (CD notwithstanding!) in my closet

As the human personification of a goldfish I eventually dropped the clojure game along with the blog. 

However a couple of days ago I got an email notification from Github that someone (Github's automated bot that updates insecure dependencies)
had pushed changes to my blog! As I am already playing around with Nim I have decided to recreate this blog. Hopefully this time I'll get a lot further along.

Why Nim?
------------
It keeps appearing on Hacker News so it must be good! Also the ability for me to make both my frontend & backend in Nim along with its powerful macro system and great community tick all the boxes for me.
